            <h1>How Do You Define Success?</h1>
            <p>As 2014 comes to a close and we prepare to turn the page on the calendar, it's inevitable that you'll think about success. Was it a successful year? Do you feel as though you accomplished what you wanted? Where did you fall short? And perhaps most importantly, how can you make 2015 even more successful?</p>
            <p>Some of those answers, of course, depend on how you define success. Like many, I grew up equating money and power with success, and for a time, that framed my definition. But as I've matured, that has changed. You see, success is a very personal thing. What drives one entrepreneur may be radically different for another. And understanding how others measure success can help you better understand your own definition.</p>
            <p>For me, it's "Success is spending the majority of my time focused on work or tasks that are fulfilling, leveraging my Zone of Genius, maximizing my potential and helping other people in a meaningful way while providing the freedom, lifestyle and experiences that I desire"</p>
            <p>As we bid farewell to another year, I've been pondering these questions too. So I approached a number of "successful" people. Most of them are CEOs or run organizations that they started. (I even included my parents!) By most people's standards, they are successful. What, then, are their definitions of success? I hope these responses inspire you to think about your own version of success. The one constant I found? We all long for daily joy and fulfillment in our work and beyond.</p>
